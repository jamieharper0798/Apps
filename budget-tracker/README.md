# Ledger — Budget & Bill Tracker

Track every subscription and recurring bill in one place: what it costs, which account it's paid from, when it's due, and how it adds up.

## Features

- Add subscriptions and bills with amount, frequency, account, category, and notes
- Flexible billing cycles: weekly, every 2 weeks, monthly, every 3 months, yearly, or a custom number of days — the app computes each bill's next due date automatically
- Dashboard with monthly total, yearly total, what's due in the next 7 days, and active bill count
- Upcoming payments list for the next 30 days, with overdue and due-soon highlighting
- Spend breakdowns by category and by account (with normalized monthly cost, regardless of billing frequency)
- Manage accounts (e.g. "Chase Checking", "Amex") with color tags — add one inline while creating a bill, or manage them fully from the accounts screen
- Built-in categories (Streaming, Software, Utilities, Insurance, etc.) plus your own custom categories with emoji + color
- Pause/resume a bill without deleting it (e.g. a paused gym membership), and it drops out of totals while you decide
- Search and filter by status, account, and category
- Currency symbol picker ($, £, €, ¥, ₹, A$, C$)
- Persisted to `localStorage` — no backend, no account required
- Installable PWA: manifest, offline-capable service worker, an in-app "Install App" button, and an update toast when a new version is deployed

## Getting started

npm install
npm run dev
```

### Icons

App icons are generated from `scripts/icon.svg` / `scripts/icon-maskable.svg` via `node scripts/gen-icons.mjs` (requires `sharp`, installed on demand: `npm install -D sharp`). Output lands in `public/icons/`.
